    "1) Use `numpy` to draw $1000$ random samples from a uniform distribution between $1$ and $10$, and store these samples as $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use matplotlib to make a histogram of these samples. Try to make this as aesthetically pleasing as possible (within reason).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Compute the exponential of your array $x$, and store this as $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Make another histogram for $y$. Using the equation to transform probability distributions in `lecture_3`, write here what the theoretical pdf of $y$ is, and overplot it onto your histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Compute the mean of $x$ and the mean of $y$. Now compute the median of $x$ and the median of $y$. How the mean and median of x and y compare to each other?"

    "This question is about Monte Carlo integration. The 3$\\sigma$ Gaussian confidence level takes the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_{-3}^{3} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) \\,dx \\approx 0.997625$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write down a python code to plot this Gaussian distribution. Can you tell what is the mean and standard daviation of this Gaussain?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Draw $N=10^5$ samples from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 3 and then perform Monte Carlo integration using the expression on the left hand side above. Confirm that this *approximately* matches the value given the right hand side of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Repeat (2) for $N=[10^2,10^3,10^4]$, computing the integral using $100$ different batches of random samples for each $N$. Record all calculated values at all $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Make a plot that shows $\\log_{10}N$ along the $x$-axis and the spread between the maximum and minimum Monte Carlo integral values that you get at each $N$ on the $y$-axis. (Note: matplotlib's `fill_between` command is useful for this). Plot a horizontal line on the same figure to show the precise mathematical value. You should see that Monte Carlo integration results in less numerical spread as $N$ gets larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) What if you had drawn N samples from a uniform distribution between $[-3, 3]$, how the accuracy of your results have changed?"
