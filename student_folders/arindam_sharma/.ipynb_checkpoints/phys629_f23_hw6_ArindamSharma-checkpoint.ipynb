    "This week also we have only one problem worth 20 points. This problem uses a dataset in `/coursework/homeworks/hw_data/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Read in `hw6_data.npy`. This is a (50 x 2) numpy array, with measurements in the first column and uncertainties in the second column. Using the analytic results for heteroscedastic Gaussian data from lectures, compute the sample mean and the standard error on the sample mean from for this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Using the bootstrap method, generate $1000$ bootstrap realizations of this dataset. *DO NOT use the `astroML` code. Write your own bootstrap function from scratch. Also recall that when resampling data, measurements and uncertainties should stay paired together.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Compute sample mean for all $1000$ boostrap datasets to find the distribution of the sample mean. Plot a normalized histogram of these bootstrap means, and overplot a Gaussian pdf with the mean and std found in (1). Do these agree?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Write a code to generate $50$ Jackknife datasets using the Jackknife method with one leave-off.  *DO NOT use the `astroML` code*. \n",
