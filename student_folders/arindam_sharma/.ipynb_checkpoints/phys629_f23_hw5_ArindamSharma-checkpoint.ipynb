    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we have only one problem worth 20 points. This problem uses a dataset in `/coursework/homeworks/hw_data/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Read in `hw5_data.npy`. This is a (50 x 2) numpy array, with measurements in the first column and uncertainties in the second column. Using the analytic results for heteroscedastic Gaussian data from lectures, compute the sample mean and the standard error on the sample mean from for this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Reusing some approaches and tools from `lecture_11`, write a ln-likelihood function for heteroscedastic Gaussian data, and use it in a fitting algorithm to find the best-fit mean. *Remember that scipy optimizers are set up to minimize functions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Using the same numerical technique from `lecture_10`, compute the Fisher uncertainty estimate on the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) While we have fitted a heteroscedastic Gaussian to this data, let's try something else. Write some code to define a ln-likelihood for a Laplace distribution evaluated on this data. Fit simultaneously for the Laplace location parameter $\\mu$ and scale parameter $\\Delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Compute the AIC values for the heteroscedastic Gaussian model and the Laplacian model. Which model is favored by the data?"
