    "2) Use the following code to compute the un-normalized posterior pdf (i.e., just the likelihood x prior) on a grid of the linear coefficient (i.e., the slope) of a linear model, with a uniform prior between 0.5 and 1.5. Plot this posterior pdf. Remember this is just a one-dimensional model because the $y$-intercept is fixed. I advise a grid size of 100."
