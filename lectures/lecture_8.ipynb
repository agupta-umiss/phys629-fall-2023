    "### Some Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "* We typically study the properties of some ***population*** by measuring ***samples*** from that population. The population doesn't have to refer to different objects. E.g., we may be (re)measuring the position of an object at rest; the population is the distribution of (an infinite number of) measurements smeared by the uncertainty, and the sample are the measurement we've actually taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A ***statistic*** is any function of the sample. For example, the sample mean is a statistic. But also, \"the value of the first measurement\" is also a statistic. Don't stress too much about how to make a statistic; it's just a way of summarizing data in a way that helps reveal the presence of a signal. We will meet ways of finding the optimal statistic for a given scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* To conclude something about the population from the sample, we develop ***estimators***. An estimator is a statistic, a rule for calculating an estimate of a given quantity based on observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are ***point*** and ***interval estimators***. The point estimators yield single-valued results (example: the position of an object), while with an interval estimator, the result would be a range of plausible values (example: confidence interval for the position of an object).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measurements have **uncertainties** (not errors) and we need to account for these (sometimes they are unknown). Data are not variables but fixed values."

    "### Frequentist vs. Bayesian Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major statistical paradigms that address the statistical inference questions: \n",
    "- the **classical**, or **frequentist** paradigm,\n",
    "- the **Bayesian** paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most of statistics and machine learning is based on the classical paradigm, Bayesian techniques are being embraced by the statistical and scientific communities at an ever-increasing pace...especially in astrophysics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key differences\n",
    "- **Definition of probabilities**:\n",
    "    - In ***frequentist inference***, probabilities describe the ***relative frequency of events*** over repeated experimental trials. \n",
    "    - In ***Bayesian infernece***, probabilities instead quantify our ***subjective belief about experimental outcomes, model parameters, or even models themselves***. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Quantifying uncertainty**:\n",
    "    - In ***frequentist inference*** we have ***confidence levels*** that describe the distribution of the measured parameter from the data around the true value.\n",
    "    - In ***Bayesian inference*** we have ***credible regions*** derived from posterior probabilitiy distributions (we'll meet these later). These encode our \"***belief spread***\" in model parameters."

    "#### Example\n",
    "Let's say that you get the results of an IQ test.  Any given test result might not give you your \"real\" IQ (whatever that means anyway...).  But it gives us a way to *estimate* it (and the possible range of values).  \n",
    "- For a frequentist, the best estimator is the average of many test results.  So, if you took 5 IQ tests and got a sample mean of 160, then that would be the estimator of your true IQ.\n",
    "- On the other hand, a Bayesian would say: \"*but wait, I know that IQ tests are calibrated to have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15 points*\".  So they will use that as \"prior\" information, which is important here since 160 is a 4$\\sigma$ outlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's nothing mysterious about priors. It simply encodes any previous knowledge or information we have about our experiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Hypothesis**: Formulate a model, a *hypothesis*, about how the data are generated. For example, the data are a measurement of some quantity with Gaussian random uncertainties (i.e., each measurement is equal to the true value, plus a deviation randomly drawn from the normal distribution). Models are typically described using a set of model parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, and written as $\\boldsymbol{M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: Search for the \"best\" model parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ which maximize the ***likelihood*** $L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\equiv p(D|M)$. This search yields the MLE *point estimates*, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta^0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantifying Estimate Uncertainty**: Determine the confidence region for model parameters, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta^0}$. Such a confidence estimate can be obtained analytically (possibly with some approximations), but can also be done numerically for arbitrary models using general frequentist techniques, such as bootstrap, jackknife, and cross-validation (we'll come to these later).\n",
