    "$x$ is a scalar quantity, measured $N$ times\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_i$ is a single measurement with $i=1,...,N$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\{x_i\\}$ refers to the set of all N measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "We are generally trying to *estimate* $h(x)$, the *true* distribution from which the values of $x$ are drawn. We will refer to $h(x)$ as the probability density (distribution) function or the \"pdf\" and $h(x)dx$ is the propobability of a value lying between $x$ and $x+dx$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"left to right\" integral of $h(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function (\"cdf\"), $H(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x}h(x')dx'$. The inverse function of the cdf is the **quantile function**, e.g., what value has 90% of the distribution below it?\n",
    "\n",
    "While $h(x)$ is the \"true\" pdf, what we *measure* from the data is the **empirical** pdf, which is denoted $f(x)$.  So, $f(x)$ is a *model* of $h(x)$.  In principle, with infinite data $f(x) \\rightarrow h(x)$, but in reality measurement errors keep this from being strictly true. Likewise, the empirical cdf is denoted $F(x)$."
