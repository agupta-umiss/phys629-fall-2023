    "The amount of raw information that is being generated every minute is extraordinary. So, whether we like it or not, we have entered the realm of **\"Big Data\"**. However, even in the realm of **\"Small Data\"**, a proper statistical treatment that accounts for statistical and systematic noise, as well as as signal dependencies on the measured output, is essential. Our work in Gravitational Wave Astronomy is far more on the **\"Small Data\"** side of things, and we'll get a small taste it."

    "**My** interest in the topic stems from ongoing gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA to be joined in the future by the space-borne LISA detector. These instruments extract detailed information about GW-emitting systems from **signals buried deep under noise**. The techniques required to do this are at the forefront of data-based inference, relying heavily on **Bayesian techniques** (we'll delve into Bayesian inference in a few weeks).\n",
